# Super Tic Tac Toe
The classic game advanced with more difficulty that requires strategy and a little bit more time to play. Players take turns playing in interior tic-tac-toe grids until they win on the exterior game board.

## Refactoring
This project was refactored from my original Super Tic Tac Toe game written in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The [original project](https://github.com/jesspaul/super-tic-tac-toe "GitHub repo for original project") was the perfect candidate for React because of the potential for reusable components and the use of state for the game logic.
